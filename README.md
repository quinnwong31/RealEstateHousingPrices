# Real Estate Housing Application
## Problem Statement
Real estate purchases, especially for first time home buyers, can be a highly emotional decision, driven by rationales that are not based on analytics.   

## Solution Overview 
The purpose of this project is to build an application that enables home buyers to make more educated decisions on real estate.   Our MVP will include the following features to start: 

- Fetches and displays historical housing prices by county in America from 2018-2022.   This will allow users to see trends, such as which counties are gaining or losing value in different formats, such as in a datagrid or a map.
- Provides predictive analytics for future real estate prices.   For example, a user will be able to execute a Monte Carlo simulations against one or more counties to see which real estate may be a better purchase.  

In addition, this project will:  
- Incorporate agile best practices for managing communications, defining user stories and iterating through feature development
- Provide viability of use of our technology stack in building a fintech web application that can be extended towards other problems

## User Stories
Our MVP will be based on the following user stories to start: 
- As a home buyer, I want to fetch historical housing prices by county in America from 2018-2022
- As a home buyer, I want to list which counties gained or loss value in a specifc timeframe
- As a home buyer, I want to view a map of which counties gained or loss value in a specific timeframe
- As a home buyer, I want to determine which county has the highest probability of gaining or losing in the future

We will groom user stories and add acceptance critera during team meetings.
